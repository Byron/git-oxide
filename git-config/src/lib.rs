//! This crate aims to parse all `git` configuration files found in the wild and apply the same restrictions by default.
//! It will do so while providing helpful error messages in case of syntax errors.
//!
//! Editing is fully supported and non-destructive.
//!
//! Additionally it's a stated goal as well to apply such restrictions only when values are read and optionally allow
//! a less limited character set. This opens up the git configuration format to other languages than English.
