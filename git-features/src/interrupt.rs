//! Process-global interrupt handling
//!
//! This module contains facilities to globally request an interrupt, which will cause supporting computations to
//! abort once it is observed.
//! Such checks for interrupts are provided in custom implementations of various traits to transparently add interrupt
//! support to methods who wouldn't otherwise by injecting it. see [`Read`].
